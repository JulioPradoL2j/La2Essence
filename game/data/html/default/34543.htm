Who's there?! Ugh, I don't like strangers. But what can you do, I suppose I need to explain what's going on here.<br>
You see, I have two younger brothers. I used to correspond with one of them, we had a good relationship. But now... well, he just locked himself away and sent me a message: "panic mode engaged" - and that's it. Since then, there's been no news, although I wrote to him many times. I set off to look for Komter - and that's what brought me here.<br>
I can't go into the fortress myself - it's too dangerous. I sense that if I go, I won't come back. So for now, I'm scouting the area, keeping an eye on things. And Komter is nowhere to be found. If you decide to go inside the fortress, just tell me about this Copter.<br>
By the way, do you know Doctor Hax? He's somewhere inside. He's dangerous too, so be extremely careful.
