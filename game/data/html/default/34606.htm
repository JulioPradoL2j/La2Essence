<html><body>Abyss Warrior Rosania:<br>
At first I was destined to become an Abyssal Celebrant and serve Elcadia, Goddess Shillien's Avatar. But I was blessed in a different way.<br>
From now on, I am the chosen Abyss Warrior, and these roses are to show that I accept its will.<br>
Ah, when I look at you it seems I see my own reflection. Fear nothing, go boldly forward.
