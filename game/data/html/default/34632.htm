<html><body>Battle Master Volkrand:<br>
I am Volkrand. I was assigned to guide newbies.<br>
The goal of every Samurai is to become stronger. This is our true destiny. Over time you will notice how easy the art of fight is getting for you, how your true self is being revealed.<br>
I dedicated all my life in battles, and still turned out unworthy of becoming Crow Spirit's successor. Maybe you will succeed? We'll see. Train without sparing yourself and get stronger.
